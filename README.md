# Chess


Basic implementation of playable chess game in the console

This was a test of mine to see how useful I found github copilot as a tool to assist coding. Overall it did speed up reaching the point of functional code, but it encouraged me to let it generate repetative and low quality code, and the time taken to read and verify the code did slow me down to not much faster than just writing it myself in the first place. For a small one-off project with problems that are fairly common, it is a useful feature to help code. But I am cautious to use AI assistance on a long-term larger project.
